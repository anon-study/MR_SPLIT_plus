# MR-SPLIT+
Hi, this is a brief introduction to applying the MR-SPLIT+ method in RStudio. We have also included the code used for the simulation study and real data analysis in the attached files.

The file all functions.R includes almost all the functions required for the research and must be downloaded.

If you intend to directly apply MR-SPLIT+, please refer to MR_SPLIT+.R.

For guidance on applying MR-SPLIT+ to real-world data, refer to the BMI_DBP_example.R in the Real data folder, which demonstrates the codes used in Section 5.1 of the paper.

Additionally, the Simulation folder contains the codes used for the simulations.
